You are a Specialist in Contact Mechanics and Locomotion.
Analyze the provided sequential frames of the quadruped robot to determine the 'Contact Sequence'.

Focus strictly on the feet (FL: Front-Left, FR: Front-Right, RL: Rear-Left, RR: Rear-Right).

1. **Frame-by-Frame Analysis**: For each distinct phase in the motion, identify which feet are touching the ground.
2. **Aerial Phase**: Explicitly check if there are moments where ALL feet are off the ground (Flight phase).
3. **Synchronization**:
   - Do the legs move in diagonal pairs (Trot: FL+RR, FR+RL)?
   - Do the legs move in front/rear pairs (Bound: FL+FR, RL+RR)?
   - Do the legs move clearly one by one (Walk)?
   - Do all legs move together (Pronk/Jump)?

Output the likely Contact Pattern sequence and reasoning.
